## Coding Guidelines

We use Eclipse as the main development platform. Also the code style of Imixs-Workflow is based on the Eclipse Code Style rules. You can import the file 'imixs-code-style.xml' into the Eclipse IDE to get the actual formating rules (_Preferences -> Java-Code-Style Formatter Profile_).

Please do not reformat existing code. If you use an other IDE like Eclipse we recommend to import an appropriate formatting style rule.
