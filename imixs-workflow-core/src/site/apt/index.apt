How does it work?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Imixs Workflow provides a framework for the development and management of business applications 
 in a very simple and flexible way. Imixs Workflow allows you to store business data and define 
 the workflow in a business process model, so you can implement your applications faster and more flexible!
 
 The Imixs Workflow project focuses on human based workflow. This means that a business process is 
 typically controlled by the user (actor). During a business process Imixs Workflow provides users 
 with all necessary information such as different task lists and process documentation. The Workflow 
 System assists users in starting a new process, finding a document and in the completion of 
 current jobs. The following illustration demonstrates the typical flow of a document or datasheet 
 from one user to another controlled by a Workflow Management System.

 The Workflow Management System - also called WFMS or Workflow System - controls the flow of a document or datasheet 
 between the different users. The workflow model defines the process flow from one actor to another.
 
* The Actors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
 A Workflow Management System controls which users can start a new business process or process a running task.
 Each business process defines different users to be involved during a workflow. These users are called Actors. 
 The Actor interacts with the Workflow Management System during a business process. 
 Actors can either start, update or read a process instance. 
 The Workflow Mangement System grants actors to access a specific process instance. 
 This means that a user which is not in involved during a workflow will not be allowed
 to access a running process instance. A Workflow Management System provides a security layer
 to process confidential business data.  
 
 
* The Workitem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
 In a Workflow Management System the document or data which is edited by different actors is called a 
 Workitem. One workitem can assume different states during a business process.
 If a workitem is still processed by actors and not yet finished the workitem is 
 called a running process instance. The status of a process instance is defined by the workflow model.
 

* The Workflow Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  The Workflow Model defines which status a process instance can present. If an actor completes a task 
  from his tasklist the process instance is processed by the
  Workflow Management System and can be assigned to a new status. This change form one status to another 
  is defined by a Workflow Activity. 
  


* Tasklist and Statuslist
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
 A Workflow Management System provides actors with different views about running process instances.
 A tasklist contains all open tasks from the view of an individual actor.
 The statuslist provides the user with the latest status information about running process instances.
 For example a tasklist can contain new customers orders from an online shop. 
 The statuslist can be used by a customer to see the current processing status of his own orders.
